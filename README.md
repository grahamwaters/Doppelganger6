# Doppelganger6
Finding what your GitHub profile could look like if you found your Doppelganger.
It is a german word which literally means “double goer”. They are or your body doubles or lookalikes and are not genetically correlated to you nor are they associated with your family tree. In German folklore, the meaning is — a specter or wraith of an alive person [1](https://medium.com/predict/doppelg%C3%A4ngers-are-real-science-dda8795bb666). So, why Doppelganger 6? Some studies claim that there are very few doppelgangers in the world but others contradict those claims and estimate that there are even up to six people in the world that look like you. So, we decided to go with the latter and hence the name Doppelganger 6.

## Summary:

The idea behind this project is to deliver the end-user with a score from 0 to 100 that is based on how well their profile on GitHub matches the career they have chosen. This will be evaluated (1) visually, (2) linguistically, and (3) based on content (projects) featured on the profile.


## Visual Analysis

The visual analysis is based on the following factors:
- Profile Picture
- Layout of the profile's main landing page
- Colors used on the page (background, text, etc.)

## Linguistic Analysis

The linguistic analysis is based on the following factors:
- The number of repositories
- The number of followers
