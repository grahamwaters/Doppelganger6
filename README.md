# Doppelganger6
Finding what your GitHub profile could look like if you found your Doppelganger.
It is a german word which literally means “double goer”. They are or your body doubles or lookalikes and are not genetically correlated to you nor are they associated with your family tree. In German folklore, the meaning is — a specter or wraith of an alive person [1](https://medium.com/predict/doppelg%C3%A4ngers-are-real-science-dda8795bb666). So, why Doppelganger 6? Some studies claim that there are very few doppelgangers in the world but others contradict those claims and estimate that there are even up to six people in the world that look like you. So, we decided to go with the latter and hence the name Doppelganger 6.

# The purpose of Doppelganger 6

You can find a lot of GitHub profiles on the internet but they are not necessarily the best ones. So, you can use Doppelganger 6 to find the best 6 doppelganger profiles to what you are hoping to create and get a better idea of how your GitHub profile should look like.
